## RDBMS: dive in optimization (workshop description):
To build successful applications it is important to pay attention on what is happening in your database. Let's be curious: why does the database behave like that? How is data stored and accessed? How do the indexes work and are they a cure for everything? What does query planner think of our queries? How else can we improve our application performance? The goal of this workshop is to bring clarity on all that and give you some tips and ideas. Eventually you will see that the database is your friend. We will mainly explore PostgreSQL as an example to see all this in action and play with it ourselves. You can use pgAdmin if you wish but it is better to illustrate with psql.
